Doing the tutorial!
I notice while doing this tutorial that the user interface I'm seeing in Microsoft Edge is slightly different from the interface shown in the screenshots in the tutorial. That's all I've got so far! I'm just starting on this new chapter in my professional life by learning Python3 and SQL! I am very excited. It's August 24, 2021, and it's a beautiful, sunny day.
